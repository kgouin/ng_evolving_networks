# The Minimal Naming Game on Evolving Social Networks
Spontaneous linguistic synchronization among groups of people constitutes a uniquely human phenomenon. Over the past decades, language game models have been designed to explore the emergence of linguistic conventions through agreement dynamics between members of a community. In this work, we explore such a model—the Minimal Naming Game—on evolving social networks, and comment on its ability to capture the agreement dynamics characteristic to the spread of misinformation we observe in this day and age.
